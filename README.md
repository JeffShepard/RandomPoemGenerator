# Random Poem Generator #
## written in Javascript, HTML and CSS ##

This website allows the user to take a poem entitled
"Man in a Jar" and to randomly change pre selected
words in the text

After looking at the other entries in this project, I realize I did not quite follow directions and instead created a website with HTML.  Still, it generates a random set of sentences.  Not sure if this meets the criteria or not.

I am using this repository to learn about Github Pages and how to deploy my repositories to Pages
